# 09-README-Generator

This README Generator is a command-line application that allows for the quick and easy generation of a project README file. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README. The content of the generated README file is collected from User input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

## Project Objective

To create a functional application that generates a professional README.md from user input. The [Good README guide](../../01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Supplemental/Good-README-Guide/README.md) was reviewed during this project to ensure that the file generated was appropriate and professional.
The application will be invoked with the following command:

```
node index.js
```
